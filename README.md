Repository that seeks for insight into YouTube Comments. The data collection is written in Python and it will collect youtube comments from a list of Youtube Channels. The analysis is written in Rust and it gives some fun insights on aspects on Youtube comment data.

The dataset is of about 181,000 different rows with comments from about 30 different podcast channels. It is sitting in this [drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cQIUzpxUpCiJb3B_OsjpsPwMK2UzXXRe?usp=drive_link) and when downloaded it should be moved to the rust project `(rust/comments.csv)`.
